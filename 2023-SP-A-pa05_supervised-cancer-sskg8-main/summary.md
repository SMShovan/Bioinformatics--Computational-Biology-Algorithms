Researchers conducted a study evaluating serum samples from several groups, including breast cancer patients, non-cancer controls, patients with other cancer kinds, and patients with non-breast benign diseases in an effort to find novel microRNA (miRNA) for early-stage breast cancer detection. For analysis, these samples were split into training and test cohorts and taken from the National Cancer Center Biobank.

The primary cause of cancer-related fatalities in Japanese women is breast cancer, and a good prognosis depends on early identification. Finding breast cancer in its early stages is still difficult, despite improvements in diagnostic methods and anticancer medications. The traditional screening approach is mammography, however due to its invasiveness and associated pain, less intrusive testing techniques, such blood analysis, are becoming required.

Circulating miRNA in serum and plasma have been identified as possible cancer indicators. While various miRNA combinations have been identified in earlier research as breast cancer indicators, their sensitivity and specificity for early-stage detection are not perfect, and there is a dearth of validated miRNA testing with an acceptable number of clinical samples.

Extracellular miRNA is used by breast cancer cells for signal transduction. Previous research has highlighted the importance of miR-23b in maintaining breast cancer cells within the bone marrow niche for future metastasis, as well as the role of extracellular vesicles harboring miR-181c in promoting brain metastasis. These findings lend support to the theory that breast cancer patients have particular circulating miRNA in their blood that can be exploited for detection.

The study looked at serum miRNA expression profiles from miRBase in large cohorts with the purpose of identifying circulating miRNA capable of diagnosing early-stage breast cancer. In the test cohort, researchers detected a combination of five miRNA (miR-1246, miR-1307-3p, miR-4634, miR-6861-5p, and miR-6875-5p) that displayed a sensitivity of 97.3%, specificity of 82.9%, and accuracy of 89.7% for breast cancer diagnosis. Notably, with a sensitivity of 98.0% for Tis, this combination was able to detect early-stage breast cancer, suggesting its potential as a powerful diagnostic tool.
